# Day 2: Dive

## Epilogue

Getting set up to use TypeScript was much more annoying than solving the problem
itself. Overall I can see how many devs ðŸ’™ TypeScript as it can catch a lot of
type safety issues at compile time rather than runtime. For this simple problem,
I found it to be frustrating, especially when trying to hook up a debugger. I'm
sure once you get set up and comfortable it's game changing and I won't be
scared away by a rough first start :)
