# Day 5: Hydrothermal Venture

## Epilogue

I chose to give TypeScript another whirl and I was not disappointed ðŸ˜„ I spent a
little more time making sure I understood how to get a project off the ground
and properly set up to debug and it was smooth sailing from there.

Admittedly, I started looking into attempting the problem in Rust, but had a
load of issues getting a debugger hooked up. After trying to set things up for
awhile, I ended up giving in and using a language and setup I was already
vaguely familiar with. The problems are starting to get involved and time
consuming enough that the added overhead of trying a new language everyday is a
little much.

I enjoyed this problem very much! It was pretty straight forward for the most
part, but there was a tricky part in which I thought that the traditional math
calculation for slope was wrong (rise/run) ðŸ˜…. Obviously, it was not wrong. The
problem paints us into the fourth quadrant in math land, where the y-axis should
be negative... but it was positive in this case. I left a comment in my solution
where I flipped that logic.
